- parallel dfs is not trivial\\
- messure the performance bottlenecks before fixing the performance!\\
- location of bottlenecks quickly become a matter of faith \\
- do not base actions on faith but on evidence, time and effort can be saved\\
- use tools which address the own context\\
- lola has potential in data representations in the context of parallelizations\\
