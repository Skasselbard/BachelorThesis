\chapter{Future Work}
- messure performance from searchAndInsert\\
- find the limiting parts which hinder parallelization from using all threads efficiently\\
- optimize at least one implementation from search and insert for parallel use\\
- if the bottleneck returns to the exploration after optimizing:\\
- find a reasonable heuristic to share work between threads\\
- maybe don't let every single thread look for other idle ones, instead consider implementing a scheduler thread, or a data structure with possible tasks\\

- the synchronization method should be considered in the parallel design of the algorithm (dont emulate mutexe if using compare and swap)

-look at the memory consumption difference with lola
